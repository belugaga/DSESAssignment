Project is about analysing a dataset on customers' satisfaction with an airline based on the following factors ease of online booking, seat comfort, check-in experience, cleanliness, baggage handling, etc.

Implemented predictive models using the Data Science Life Cycle method (CRISP-DM) to identify the airline's strengths and areas of focus to gain customers' satisfaction with the airline.

The following sections are found in the Jupyter code file:
- Business & Data Analysis with understanding of dataset, 
- Cleaning & Transformation of dataset, 
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, k-Means Clustering) to find which model best suit the dataset, and finding relevant/important attributes,
- Recommendations to be given to the airline to increase customers' satisafction rate based on the weight (importance) of an attribute/feature.
